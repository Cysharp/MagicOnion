# MagicOnion.Client.SourceGenerator.Tests

This project is a test project for the cilent-side Source Generator.

This test project performs execution tests of the Source Generator and verifies the execution results through snapshot tests.

## Snapshot tests

The snapshot test data is stored under `Resources`. This data can be generated by enabling `#define WRITE_EXPECTED` in `Verifiers/MagicOnionSourceGeneratorVerifier.cs` and running the tests. If changes are made to the code generation, the data must be regenerated.
