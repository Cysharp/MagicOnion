# MagicOnion

Unified Realtime/API framework for .NET platform and Unity.

https://github.com/Cysharp/MagicOnion

## About MagicOnion
MagicOnion is a RPC framework for .NET platform that provides bi-directional real-time communications such as [SignalR](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master/src/SignalR) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) and RPC mechanisms such as WCF and web-based APIs.

This framework is based on [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), which is a fast and compact binary network transport for HTTP/2. However, unlike plain gRPC, it treats C# interfaces as a protocol schema, enabling seamless code sharing between C# projects without the `.proto` (Protocol Buffers IDL).
